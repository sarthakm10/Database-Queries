-- Create employees table
CREATE TABLE employees (

);

-- Insert sample data including duplicates
INSERT INTO employees (name, department, salary) VALUES
    ('Alice', 'HR', 50000),
    ('Bob', 'Finance', 60000),
    ('Charlie', 'IT', 70000),

-- View all employees

-- Example 1: Using DISTINCT on a single column
-- Get unique departments
SELECT DISTINCT department 
FROM employees;

-- Example 2: Using DISTINCT on multiple columns
-- Get unique department-salary combinations
SELECT DISTINCT department, salary 
FROM employees;

-- Example 3: Using DISTINCT with aggregate functions
-- Count number of unique departments
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department) AS unique_departments 
FROM employees;

-- Example 4: Using DISTINCT with string functions
-- Get unique name-department combinations
SELECT DISTINCT CONCAT(name, '-', department) 
FROM employees;

-- Example 5: Using DISTINCT with ORDER BY
-- Get unique salaries in descending order
SELECT DISTINCT salary 
FROM employees 
ORDER BY salary DESC;

-- Example 6: Using DISTINCT with WHERE clause
-- Get unique departments where salary is greater than 50000
SELECT DISTINCT department 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary > 50000;

-- Display current data
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Example 7: Handling NULL values with DISTINCT
-- Insert records with NULL departments
INSERT INTO employees (name, department, salary) VALUES 
    ('Grace', NULL, 48000),
    ('Bobby', NULL, 48000);

-- Show how DISTINCT handles NULL values
SELECT DISTINCT department 
FROM employees;
